# OkarTTSS

My own public transport map implementing Krak√≥w's TTSS system, using leaflet and socket.io. For now, only trams are visible, but I'm doubtful about adding buses.

Run `npm run tsc` to compile server's code, `node .` in root directory to run it. Run `npm run webpack` to compile website scripts into one.
